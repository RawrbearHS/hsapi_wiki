# Hopscript

## Fundamental goals

The most important goals of hopscript should be:

- Represent _any_ hopscotch code in a textual form.
- Be simple to understand coming exclusively from regular hopscotch
- Easily and simply interface with existing hopscotch code, both ways

## Secondary goals

These are goals that are still very important, but not _quite_ as important as the ones above.

- 1 to 1 dehopscotchification – dehopscotchify regular hopscotch code into hopscript that will
  rehopscotchify into identical code, ignoring things like specific internal ids and such.
- User defineable blocks – useful for modding
- Reasonable response to name shadowing – if you have a local variable called `and` it should be
  able to be unambiguously differentiated from the block called `and`, and the compiler should do that,
  even if it isn't a particularly good variable name.
- Easy extensibility – I ahve some ideas on how to do this later in this post.


## To-do list

Here is a list of what needs to happen to get to a finished version of hopscript. I have combined things that can be done simultaneously under a single number header

#### Step 1

- Create first version of hsapi, needed for hopscotchification
- Implement parser
- Implement parts of the extensions section that don't require hsapi

#### Step 2

- Create hopscotchificator

#### Step 3

- Make projects with hopscript and improve syntax
- Create dehopscotchificator
- Create extension interperator

#### Step 4

- Start using extensions more in base hopscript, ie remove hardcoded definitions of scopes
