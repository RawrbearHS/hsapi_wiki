# Ability

Abilities are broadly classified as any group of [blocks](/wiki/spec/block), which are
referenced by [rules](/wiki/spec/rule) and [loop blocks](/wiki/spec/block#loops).


## Metadata

### `abilityID`

<PropertyData type="string" />

An ability's unique identifier, to be referenced elsewhere.

```json
"abilityID": "561D32F8-FD6B-45E0-9DFF-3191085E2351-3248-00005BE3B1E67098"
```


### `createdAt`

<PropertyData type="number" />

The ability's time of creation. Used to order custom blocks in the app's block picker.

The decimal represents the number of seconds since January 1, 2001 at 00:00 UTC.

```json
"createdAt": 528311636.47971
```


## Metadata (Custom Block)

### `name`

<PropertyData type="string" />

The name of a custom block.

If this value is empty, the custom block will not appear in the app's block picker, and vice versa.
Having an identical name as other custom blocks works fine.

```json
"name": "Do a Cool Trick"
```

## Pointer Arrays

### [`blocks`](/wiki/spec/block)

<PropertyData type="array" />

Contains object references to the [blocks](/wiki/spec/block) within the ability.
