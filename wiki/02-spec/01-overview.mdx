# Overview

Hopscotch projects are [JSON files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). They are stored on the mobile app as `.hopscotch` files.

Essentially, [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is a file format which organizes data using pairs of names and values,
like a checklist, which both people and computers can easily read. For example:

```json
{ // {} means it's a list of pairs
	"name": "Alice",
	"age": 12,
	"homework_finished": false,
	"hobbies": ["coding", "drawing"], // [] means it's a list of single items
	"pets": [ // {} inside of [] count as single items!
		{
			"name": "bailey",
			"age": 2,
			"bio": { // {} inside of {}? No problem!
				"description": "My lovely puppy!",
				"status": "adorable"
			}
		},
		{
			"name": "max",
			"age": 7
		}
	]
}
```

## Anatomy

Projects are essentially containers inside of containers:

- [Scenes](/wiki/spec/scene) contain a list of unique [object](/wiki/spec/object) identifiers (IDs).
  - [Objects](/wiki/spec/object) contain a list of IDs to [rules](/wiki/spec/rule) and [custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance).
   - [Custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance) are checked first by the web player<Note note="needs verification" />,
     containing a reference to a [custom rule](/wiki/spec/custom-rule), as well as the [parameters](/wiki/spec/parameter) for that custom rule.
   - [Rules](/wiki/spec/rule) contain an ID to an [ability](/wiki/spec/ability).
   - [Abilities](/wiki/spec/ability) contain blocks, which can themselves contain abilities or [parameters](/wiki/spec/parameter).

## Nuances

[Custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance) have the same properties as [objects](/wiki/spec/object).

## Viewing Types

Types are magic numbers used in blocks, objects and parameters, which define their behavior.

Use the HS Tools API to view the latest data.

:::tip

Due to the webplayer's data format, keys that end with zeroes will be formatted in scientific notation. For instance:

- `300` becomes `3e2`
- `4000` becomes `4e3`
