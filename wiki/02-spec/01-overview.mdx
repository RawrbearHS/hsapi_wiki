# Overview

Hopscotch projects are JSON files. They are stored on the mobile app as `.hopscotch` files.

## Anatomy

Projects are essentially containers inside of containers:

- [Scenes](/wiki/spec/scene) contain a list of unique [object](/wiki/spec/object) identifiers (IDs).
  - [Objects](/wiki/spec/object) contain a list of IDs to [rules](/wiki/spec/rule) and [custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance).
   - [Custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance) are checked first by the web player<Note note="needs verification" />,
     containing a reference to a [custom rule](/wiki/spec/custom-rule), as well as the [parameters](/wiki/spec/parameter) for that custom rule.
   - [Rules](/wiki/spec/rule) contain an ID to an [ability](/wiki/spec/ability).
   - [Abilities](/wiki/spec/ability) contain blocks, which can themselves contain abilities or [parameters](/wiki/spec/parameter).

## Nuances

[Custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance) have the same properties as [objects](/wiki/spec/object).
