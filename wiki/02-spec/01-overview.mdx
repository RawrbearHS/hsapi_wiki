# Overview

Hopscotch projects are JSON files. They are stored on the mobile app as `.hopscotch` files.

## Anatomy

Projects are essentially containers inside of containers:

- [Scenes](/wiki/spec/scene) contain a list of [object](/wiki/spec/object) IDs (pointers).
  - [Objects](/wiki/spec/object) contain a list of pointers to [rules](/wiki/spec/rule) and [custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance).
    - [Custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance) are checked first by the web player. They contain an [ability](/wiki/spec/ability)'s pointer.

## Nuances

[Custom rule instances](/wiki/spec/custom-rule-instance) have the same properties as [objects](/wiki/spec/object).

[Rules](/wiki/spec/rule) contain a pointer to an [ability](/wiki/spec/ability).

[Abilities](/wiki/spec/ability) contain blocks, which can themselves contain abilities.
