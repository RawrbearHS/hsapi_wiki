## Metadata

### `user`

<PropertyData type="object" />



### `uuid`

<PropertyData type="string" />

Project UUIDs are short identifiers for projects. They are assigned at the end of a project's URL, when it is published online.

```
https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xjerz8lre
        |    project slug ─┘  uuid ─┘
        └─ community subdomain
```

- Project UUIDs are calculated by Hopscotch's servers when a project is uploaded.
- UUIDs are calculated by taking the current unix timestamp in seconds, multiplied by `65536`, then converted to Base36.
- Significantly older projects use a different UUID format. Projects newer than around late 2014<Note note="needs research" /> will usually follow the current format.

```json
"uuid": "xjerz8lre"
```


## Metadata (Remix)

These properties only exist in remixed projects.

Editing these properties will update the remixed draft locally, displaying the edited remix badge in the Hopscotch app's draft menu.
However, upon publishing the remix online, these properties are overwritten by Hopscotch's server.

### `original_user`

<PropertyData type="object" />

Contains a [user object](/wiki/spec/online-project-properties#user) describing the original creator of the remixed project.

Used for displaying the remix badge in the drafts menu.


### `previous_project_uuid`

<PropertyData type="string" />

Contains the [UUID](#uuid) of the project that was remixed to create this one.
