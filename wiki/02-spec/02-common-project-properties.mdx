# Common Project Properties

The following properties are present in the root of a project's JSON.

Default values may be different depending on if the project was initially created on
an iPad, iPhone, or the web player.


## Metadata

### `baseObjectScale`

<PropertyData type="number" defaultValue="1" playerVersion="<1.5.16" />

*Unused in modern [player versions](/wiki/spec/version-history#player-versions).*

Scales character SVGs by a factor of its value. Does not scale shapes or text.

*In any versioned webplayer<Note note="when first?" />, the value is replaced with `0.5` for normal-sized shapes (ones that are accessible from the editor),
and uses a value of `1` for other shapes.*

```json
"baseObjectScale": 1
```


### `edited_at`

<PropertyData type="string" />

Contains a timestamp with the last time the draft was edited.

*For an online project's publish date, see [published_at](#) and [correct_published_at](#).*

```json
"edited_at": "2024-09-09T15:22:57Z"
```


### `fontSize`

<PropertyData type="number" defaultValueiPad="80" defaultValueiPhone="72" />

Scales the text size.

If this value is too big, the text line height will exceed
the maximum threshold the player can handle, cutting off the text in the middle.<Note note="needs elaboration" />

```json
"fontSize": 80
```


### `playerUpgrades`

<PropertyData type="object" defaultValue="{}" />

Contains a history of [player version](/wiki/spec/version-history#player-versions) upgrades.
Populates when the project's player is upgraded via the drafts menu.

In the Hopscotch app, you can upgrade older projects' players by tapping the ellipsis (...),
then selecting "Update to Latest Player".
This updates the project's `playerVersion` property, and appends the old and new player versions to `playerUpgrades`.

For example, this represents an upgrade from player version `2.0.0` to version `2.1.1`:

```json
playerUpgrades: {
    "2.0.0": "2.1.1"
}
```


### `playerVersion`

<PropertyData type="string" />

Contains the [web player version](/wiki/spec/version-history#player-versions). Uses semantic versioning.

```json
"playerVersion": "2.1.1"
"playerVersion": "1.5.15"
```


### `requires_beta_editor`

<PropertyData type="boolean" />

Determines if the project is saved with the advanced editor. When set to `true`,
projects require a Hopscotch subscription to edit.

```json
requires_beta_editor: true
```


### `stageSize`

<PropertyData type="object" defaultValueMobile="screen resolution" defaultValueWebEditor="1366x1024" />

Contains the dimensions of the project stage.

```json
"stageSize": {
    "width": 1366,
    "height": 1024
}
```



### `version`

<PropertyData type="number" />

Represents the latest [Hopscotch app version](/wiki/spec/version-history#app-versions) which a project was saved in.
Older versions of the Hopscotch app will not open projects with a later `version`.

If `version <=24`, the app will use the old player instead of the web player.

```json
"version": 34
```



## Pointer Arrays

The following properties are arrays of objects which are referred to project-wide using id-based "pointers".

<PropertyData type="array" />
The array contains a list of the relevant type of object.
