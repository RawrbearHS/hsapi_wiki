# Project Attributes

The following attributes are present in the root of a project's JSON.


## Metadata


### `playerVersion`

<AttributeData type="string" />

Contains the [web player version](wiki/02-spec/player-version-history.md). Uses semantic versioning.

```json
"playerVersion": "2.1.1"
"playerVersion": "1.5.15"
```


### `uuid`

<AttributeData type="string" />

Project UUIDs are short identifiers for projects. They are assigned at the end of a project's URL, when it is published online.

```
https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xjerz8lre
        |    project slug ─┘  uuid ─┘
        └─ community subdomain
```

- Project UUIDs are calculated when a project is published. This is by default, and can be changed manually.<sup><i>[needs verification]</i></sup>
- UUIDs are calculated by taking the current unix timestamp in milliseconds, multiplied by `65536`, then converted to Base36.

```json
"uuid": "xjerz8lre"
```


### `version`

<AttributeData type="number" />

Represents the latest version of Hopscotch which a project was saved in.

```json
"version": 34
```


## Pointer Arrays


### `customObjects`

<AttributeData type="array" />

Stores the project's [custom objects](/wiki/spec/custom-object).


### `traits`

<AttributeData type="array" />

Stores the project's [traits](/wiki/spec/trait).



## Micsellaneous


### `baseObjectScale`

<AttributeData type="number" defaultValue="1" playerVersion="<1.5.16" />

*Unused in modern [player versions](/wiki/02-spec/player-version-history.md).*

Scales character SVGs by a factor of its value. Does not scale shapes or text.

*In version `1.5.16`, the value is replaced with `0.5` for normal-sized shapes (ones that are accessible from the editor),
and uses a value of `1` for other shapes.*<sup><i>[needs verification]</i></sup>

```json
"baseObjectScale": 1
```
